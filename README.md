# WhitbreadAssessment

First of all, the language I chose is Swift.

I have made the app using a split view controller.
In this split view controller, you'll find a Search Bar where you can search a place such as Paris, London, New-York.
When you click on Search on your keyboard, a request will be sent.
The resulting venues will be displayed in the tableView below. You'll see the name of each returned venue.
You can tap on a cell and you'll find the associated Id of the venue. On the detail, whatever the devices you use, the id will be centered in the content due to Auto-layout constraint.

I wish I had more time to create custom object according to the foursquare API documentation to have more to display on the detail controller.
